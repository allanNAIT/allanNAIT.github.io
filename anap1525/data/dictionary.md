title: Data Dictionary
---

## Purpose
Adds details that are not typically included in DFDs, ERDs, or other documentation. There are many types of data dictionaries available and they focus on different jobs.

## Terms
* **Data Attribute**: is the smallest piece of data that has meaning to the end-users and the business.
* **Data Structures**: are specific arrangements of data attributes that define the organization of a single instance data needed for a task such as a screen, report or data flow.

## 3 Basic Types
* **Sequence** – a group of data attributes that occur one after another in order.
* **Selection** – one or more attributes chosen from a set of attributes.
* **Repetition** – a group of one or more attributes that may have multiple instances within a larger data structure.

## Data Structure Symbols
* `=`: means “consists of” or “is composed of”
* `+`: means “and” and designates a sequence
* `[...]`: means only one of the attributes listed within the brackets may be present, and designates selection
* `{...}`: means the attributes within the braces may occur many times for one instance of the main data structure and designates repetition
* `(...)`: means that the attribute(s) within the parentheses are optional and may not always be present

## Sequence Data Structure

**Document Example** | **Data Structure**
---------------------|-------------------
[document-example-1](files/document-examnple-1.jpg) | **Wage And Tax Statement** = Taxpayer Identification Number + Taxpayer Name + Taxpayer Address + Wages, Tips And Compensation + Federal Tax Withheld + ...

## Selection Data Structure

**Document Example** | **Data Structure**
---------------------|-------------------
[document-example-2](files/document-examnple-2.jpg) | **Order** = [Personal Customer Number, Corporate Account Number ] + Order Date + ...

## Repetition Data Structure

**Document Example** | **Data Structure**
---------------------|-------------------
put picture here | **Claim** = Policy Number + Policyholder Name + Policyholder Address +0{Dependent Name + Dependent's Relationship}N + 1{Expense Description + Service Provider + Expense Amount}N

## Optional and Reusable Attributes

**Document Example** | **Data Structure**
---------------------|-------------------
[document-example-3](files/document-examnple-3.jpg) | **Claim** = Policy Number + Policy Date = Date + Policyholder Name + Policyholder Address +(Spouse Name + Date of Birth = Date) + ...<br>**Date** = Month + Day + Year

## Example Creation of a Data Dictionary
* Start with an entity on an ERD.
* Document the attributes, but keep an eye for potential reuse of data structures.
* Fully break down one data structure before moving to a new entity from the ERD.
