title: CSAW TV Broadcast Scheduling System
---

At CSAW T.V., June MacDonald, the scheduler, is responsible for the daily timing of all broadcasts. This includes programs, advertisements and station identification slides. Three weeks in advance, the Program Manager sends a list of programs to be shown to the scheduler **AFTER** the Purchasing Department has collected the program length and content information from the distributor into the Program file. This information is provided to the schedule clerk.

Upon receipt of the program listing, June uses this information and the information from the Program file to schedule the programs. At the same time, she selects the appropriate Station Identification for that time of the year. She then enters all this information into the Schedule file. Each workday, June uses the Schedule file to calculate and update the available time for advertisements. She then informs the Sales Department of the available times she has for advertising.

Later, the Sales Department sends the scheduler a list of the advertising they have sold. She then schedules the sold advertising into the available time slots. When the schedule deadline has been reached there are instances when all the available advertising space is not sold. In these situations, June chooses the appropriate number of National Film Board Vignettes from the Vignette library to fill in the gaps and updates the Schedule file accordingly. She then prints out the completed schedule and sends it to the Broadcast Operator.
