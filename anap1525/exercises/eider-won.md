The Sales Department clerk opens the mail and checks the customer orders for completeness. The customer information in the order is updated in the Customer records. Incomplete orders are sent to the Customer Relations Department clerk, who flags them as “Incomplete” and returns the order to the customer with an explanation of the problem.

The orders with a “complete” status are sent to the Accounting Department, who accesses the Customer file to check on their credit rating. For the orders that do not pass the credit rating process, the Accounting Department creates a refusal letter and sends this letter and the “rejected” customer order to the customer.

The Accounting Department forwards the “Approved” orders to the Purchasing Department, who check the Inventory file to ensure that there is enough inventory to fill the order. If there is not enough inventory to completely fill the order, the Purchasing Department issues a Purchase Order to get the necessary inventory. This is done by accessing the Supplier file to determine which suppliers carry the product. The Purchasing Department sends the Purchase Order to the appropriate supplier. The “unfilled” order with their copy of the Purchase Order is filed and the customer is sent a backorder notice.

If there is sufficient inventory available, the Shipping Department receives the order and prepares a four-part packing slip. One copy is returned to the Sales Department. A two-part invoice is created; one part is sent to the Accounting Department with a copy of the packing slip.

The Shipping Department pulls the inventory items from the warehouse, adjusts the inventory levels and ships the order to the customer with a copy of the packing slip and the top copy of the two-part invoice. The fourth copy of the packing slip is filed within the Shipping Department. The customer order is stamped "Finished" and filed.
