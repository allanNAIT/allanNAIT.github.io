title: Happy Dragon Electronics - Order Processing System
---

Happy Dragon Electronics has a department dedicated to handling Orders. When a customer sends an Order, the Order clerk verifies the Order to ensure that all the necessary information has been entered.

If the Order is verified as correct and complete, the Order clerk then inputs the Customer information that appears on the Order form, into the Customer file. If the Customer is a repeat Customer, the clerk updates the Customer information. If the Order request is incomplete or incorrect, the Order clerk files the incomplete Order with a status of "Incomplete".

The Order clerk enters the new Order and then checks the Discount file for each electronic item on the order for any Discounts associated with the electronic item, and files the original Order request. Any Order with Discounts is flagged as "Discounted".

Once a week the Order clerk contacts all Customers that have order with an "Incomplete" status. An Incomplete Order notification is sent to each customer with a copy of the incomplete Order. When the Customer provides the needed information, the Order clerk enters this information onto the original Order request form, and then processes the Order request using existing procedures.
