title: Hotel Reservation System
---

The guest arrives and heads to your reception/front desk. The guest is identified and has their details checked through a search of reservation by code or customer name. The clerk will verify if the check-in is early or late by verifying with the hotel info file and the appropriate response is followed. Once found the staff will confirm details such as pre-payment or payment upon arrival. A credit card will be used to secure a damage deposit. Once all payment needs are satisfied, the clerk will create a magnetic key card for customer. Front desk staff will give the guest an introduction to the hotel. The guest will take note of amenities and regulations etc. and ask any questions. The clerk updates the room status to occupied, and the reservation to checked in.

Late check in (after 11pm) for payment on arrival guest can be arranged by contacting the hotel and paying for room. All unpaid reserved rooms are released after 11pm on the day of check in.

Early check in is managed by availability â€“ check in is 2pm, but if a guest arrives after 10am on day of reservation and housekeeping has done a complete turnaround on the room and released it for service, they can check in early. For non-plus members there is a $25 charge. Free for plus members. If wanting to check in early than 10 am the guest must pay for another full day rental fee at the rate of their existing reservation.

A reservation cancellation informs the hotel that a previously reserved room is once again available, and helps the front desk more effectively manage its room inventory. Reservation Cancellation, like any guest service, require the hotel staff to be polite, courteous, and effective as possible. Cancellation policy is full refund if requested 24 hours prior to reservation day. No refund will be granted after that period, but a 15% rate reduction coupon can be requested by guest for future use.

Guest requests checkout. Desk clerk makes inquiries about quality of products and services. Guest returns key to desk clerk. Room is put into a status of ready for cleaning. Credit card fee is released after housekeeping confirms satisfactory condition of the room.
