All student requests for lessons are placed into the Request file folder. The Request folder is checked daily to see if any lessons have a sufficient number of students to warrant a class. If the number of students is greater than the minimum number needed to hold a class for a particular lesson, the clerk checks the list of available instructors. The clerk contacts the instructor, providing the lesson information and number of students. The instructor either accepts or rejects the teaching assignment. If the instructor refuses, the clerk will contact the next available instructor.

When an instructor accepts, the clerk prepares the class list using the Instructor, Request, and Lesson files. The original class list is filed in the file cabinet.

First thing the next day the clerk sends a copy of the class list to the instructor. The class list contains the date, time, location, type of lesson, number of students and their names. The clerk also sends a class confirmation letter to each student.
