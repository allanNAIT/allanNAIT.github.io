title: C.U. Textbook Inventory System
---

The purpose of the Textbook Inventory System at the Computer University (CU) bookstore is to track and monitor textbook orders for classes at the university. Each university academic department submits initial data about courses, instructors, textbooks and projected enrollments to the bookstore on a Department Requisition.

When the bookstore personnel receive a requisition, they sort the requested textbooks by ISBN, then generate Purchase Orders and send them to each appropriate publisher. The bookstore then files the requisition and a copy of the purchase orders in two separate files before sending the original copy of the purchase orders to each publisher.

The textbooks arrive at the bookstore, accompanied by a Packing Slip. This packing slip is checked and verified against the purchase order by the bookstore. The verified packing slip is then stamped “verified” and sent to the Accounting department for payment.
