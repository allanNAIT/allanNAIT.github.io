title: Muther Truckers Ltd. - Maintenance System
---

Truck drivers for Muther Truckers Ltd. are expected to keep their trucks in good repair. Due to the distance of the hauls, two drivers are assigned to each load. Only one driver is assigned a truck, the other driver 'floats' from truck to truck as the relief driver and is not assigned to any specific truck. When drivers quit or retire, trucks become available, and drivers complete a request to be assigned to a truck. Usually the driver with the most seniority and best safety record is awarded a new truck when the company purchases one.

The Office Manager assigns a truck and updates the driver information for that vehicle into the truck log file. The assigned driver is responsible for his/her truck log. The Office Manager also gives each assigned driver a paper copy of this truck log which is to be kept with each vehicle at all times.

If a driver detects a malfunction with his/her assigned vehicle, he/she will complete Repair Request form and send this completed form to the company repair shop so an appointment time and day can be established. This Repair Request is filed within the repair shop. When an appointment time for the truck has been set, the repair supervisor will notify the driver.

When the driver brings the truck to the repair shop, the repair shop supervisor checks the paper truck log with the contents of the truck log file, pulls the Repair Request, and obtains any additional information necessary to prepare the work order. The Repair Request is stapled to the paper copy of the work order.

The repair supervisor assigns a mechanic to the job and updates the work order to reflect this. The assigned mechanic diagnoses the trouble, obtains the necessary parts from the Parts department, updates the parts inventory by cross-referencing the work order number against the part number, and performs the repairs.

When the repairs are completed, repair supervisor enters the labor cost and part cost information onto the work order, updates the truck log file, and prints a paper copy of the truck log for the driver. The repair supervisor then files the top copy of the completed work order and sends the remaining copy to the Accounting department.

Monthly, the Office Manager accesses the truck log file to prepare the necessary reports for the Regional Manager in Toronto.
