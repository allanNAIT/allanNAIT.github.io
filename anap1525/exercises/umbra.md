title: Umbra's Vehicle Maintenance System
---

Umbra's Auto Sales Inc. is the leading West Coast dealership of Phantom Motors. Although Umbra's Auto Sales gives relatively good prices for both new and used cars, it has always had a reputation for over aggressive salespeople. One of the dealership strengths is its repair shop, which is recognized for both high quality service and fair prices.

When a customer brings their vehicle in for repair, the Service Manager completes a work order form with the customer and obtains the customer's signature. Later, the Service Manager then checks the customer file for credit history and vehicle file to obtain the history of the vehicle, marking anything of importance on the work order form. The Service Manager then accesses the mechanic file, which contains information about the specialty of each mechanic, to determine which mechanic[s] should be assigned to the vehicle. The mechanic number is recorded on the work order form. The Service Manager then hands the “Assigned” work order to the designated mechanic.

The assigned mechanic will verify the problem diagnosed by the Service Manager and call the customer with the estimate to fix the vehicle. The mechanic will note the customer response on the work order form for information purposes. The mechanic will go to the Parts Department to obtain the needed parts to fix the vehicle. The mechanic then records the part number, the quantity, and the unit price for each part onto the work order form and the Inventory Sheet. Once the repairs are completed, the mechanic records the time spent on each activity and totals both the parts and labor columns.

The mechanic then gives the completed work order form to the Service Manager, who reviews the repairs, provides additional comments as needed and verifies the totals. The Service Manager then files the completed service order until the customer arrives to pick up their vehicle.

 When the customer returns to pick up their vehicle, the Service Manager reviews the repairs and total with the customer. The customer pays for the repairs. The Service Manager records the payment on the Work Order then gives a receipt along with a copy of the work order form. The customer obtains their keys and drives off.
