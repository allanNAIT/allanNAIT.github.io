## Visual Processing
* Anything that is seen by our eyes must be processed
* The processing difficulty depends the complexity of the visual scene and on our previous memory of the scene
* Images that we already are familiar with simply match to images stored in our memory
  * The processing time is fast
  * The processing effort is low

## Organization of Screen Elements
There are 10 elements of screen design:
### Balance
* Equal weight of screen elements
  * Left to right, top to bottom

**Balaanced** | **Unstable**
--------------|-------------
![balance-1](files/balance-1.png)<br>Left column processed - right column  start position noted as same | ![balance-2](files/balance-2.png)<br>Both columns need to be completely processed

### Symmetry
* Replicate elements left and right of the center line

**Symmetric** | **Asymmetric**
--------------|---------------
![symmetry-1](files/symmetry-1.png)<br>Left column processed - right column noted as same | ![symmetry-2](files/symmetry-2.png)<br>Both left & right columns processed plus relationship of right to left

### Regularity
* Create standard and consistent spacing on horizontal and vertical alignment points

**Regular** | **Irregular**
------------|--------------
![regularity-1](files/regularity-1.png)<br>Left column processed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 right columns noted as same | ![regularity-2](files/regularity-2.png)<br>Location & size of each object processed

### Predictability
* Put things in predictable locations on the screen

**Predictable** | **Spontaneous**
----------------|----------------
![predictability-1](files/predictability-1.png)<br>User expects title and menu bar on top of screen | ![predictability-2](files/predictability-2.png)<br>Visual scene needs to be completely processed - objects not in expected places

### Sequentiality
* Guide the eye through the task in an obvious way
  * The eye is attracted to:
    * Bright elements over less bright ![sequentiality-1](files/sequentiality-1.png)  ![sequentiality-2](files/sequentiality-2.png)
    * Isolated elements over grouped
    * Graphics before text
    * Color before monochrome
    * Saturated vs. Less saturated colors
    * Dark areas before light
    * Big vs. Small elements
    * Unusual shapes over usual ones 

**Sequential** | **Random**
---------------|-----------
![sequentiality-3](files/sequentiality-3.png) | ![sequentiality-4](files/sequentiality-4.png)

### Economy
* Use as few styles, fonts, colors, display techniques, dialog styles, etc., as possible

**Economical** | **Busy**
---------------|---------
![economy-1](files/economy-1.png) | ![economy-2](files/economy-2.png)

### Unity
* Make items appear as a unified whole (for visual coherence)
  * Use similar shapes, sizes, or colors
  * Leave less space between screen elements than at the margin of the screen

**Unity** | **Fragmentation**
----------|------------------
![unity-1](files/unity-1.png) | ![unity-2](files/unity-2.png)

### Proportion
* Create groupings of data or text by using aesthetically pleasing proportions

### Simplicity
* Minimize the number of aligned points
  * Use only a few columns to display screen elements

**Simple** | **Complex**
-----------|------------
![simplicity-1](files/simplicity-1.png)<br>Only four alignments need to be processed | ![simplicity-2](files/simplicity-2.png)<br>A total of nine alignments need to be processed

### Groupings
* Provide functional groupings by associated elements
  * Create spatial groupings, evenly spaced
  * Allow 1/8 to 1/4 inch between
* Visually reinforcing groupings
  * Provide adequate separation between groupings through white space
  * Provide line borders around groups

#### Simple Grouping
* Similar elements aligned vertically
* Vertical distance between similar objects small
![grouping-1](files/grouping-1.png)

#### Boxed Grouping
* Boxes add additional complexity to form
* Spatial arrangement adequate
![grouping-2](files/grouping-2.png)

#### Background Grouping
* Color adds additional visual complexity
* Spatial arrangement adequate
![grouping-3](files/grouping-3.png)

## Examples
![example-1](files/example-1.jpg)<br>
**Question**: What is wrong, or can be improved?

![example-2](files/example-2.jpg)
**Note**: Notice the improvements make this form easier to use.

## Screen Design
Users want:
* Orderly, clean, clutter-free appearance
* Obvious indication of what is being shown and 	what should be done
* Expected information located where it should be
* Plain, simple English (Language)

### Text
* Fundamental goal is clarity and simplicity
  * Noticeable and disguisable
  * Interpretable and attractive
  * No translations, external references to documents
  * Be consistent

* Guidelines
  * Used mixed-case for:
    * Control captions
    * Data
    * Text
    * Messages
    * Instructional information
    * Menu & button descriptions
  * Use upper-case or capitalization for
    * Title
    * Section & sub-section headings

### Fonts
* Use a <span class="sans">sans serif font</span>
  * Easier to read
* Which is easier to read?
![font-choice](files/font-choice.jpg)

* Use simple readable fonts
  * Sans serif (e.g., Arial, Helvetica)
  * Times Roman (serif)
* Use no more than <span class="orange">two</span> families
  * Assign separate <span class="orange">purpose</span> to each family
  * Allow one to <span class="orange">dominate</span>
    * Headings, subheadings, etc.

* Use no more than:
  * Two styles of the same family (e.g., standard and italic)
  * Two weights
    * Regular and bold

* Use no more than <span class="orange">three</span> sizes
  * Usually 12 pt. for menus
  * 10 pt. for windows
  * Minimum is 8 pt.
* Never change established type sizes to squeeze in text!
* Always consider the visual capabilities of the users.

**8-point font** | **12-point font**
-----------------|------------------
![font-size-1](files/font-size-1.jpg) | ![font-size-2](files/font-size-2.jpg)

### Fonts & Colours
* <span class="red">Avoid</span> <span class="green1">using</span> <span class="yellow">colored</span> <span class="green2">fonts</span>
* Use bold for **emphasis**
  * Do not use color: users typically assume color is a cue for text with a different or specific purpose, such as hyperlink.
* Avoid changing font size
  * Does not get attention, is distracting
* Use color to get <span class="red">attention</span>
  * Use when it is critical that users notice a certain part of the screen<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;**<span class="red">STATUS</span>**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<span class="green1">STATUS</span>**
* Use color purposefully
  * Use sparingly or it loses its effectiveness
  * Combine color with redundant highlighting

![colurs-1](files/colours-1.jpg)

* Be aware of color blindness
  * Blue-green, red-green
  * 9% men, 2% of women
* Use colors consistently
  * Red: always warning (?)
  * Green: always good (?)
* Use cultural color meanings
  * Red, yellow, green, blue, black 
* Use light backgrounds for main areas
  * Off-whites and light grays
  * Increases contrast

![colours-2](files/colours-2.jpg)<br>vs.<br>![colours-3](files/colours-3.jpg)

* Avoid <span class="red">red</span> and <span class="blue">blue</span> combinations
  * Avoid blue text
![colours-4](files/colours-4.jpg)

* Avoid light text on dark
![colours-5](files/colours-5.jpg)

### Choosing Graphics
* Use graphics for a purpose
  * Icons
  * Button Images
  * Descriptive graphics
    * Picture of house in a real estate application
* Use graphics for international use
  * Sometimes better than particular language
  * Meaning same for everyone
* Use standard graphics
  * Already tested with users
    * Know that meaning is understood across user population
  * Guidelines
    * Windows
    * Mac
    * UNIX
