## Visual Processing
* Anything that is seen by our eyes must be processed
* The processing difficulty depends the complexity of the visual scene and on our previous memory of the scene
* Images that we already are familiar with simply match to images stored in our memory
  * The processing time is fast
  * The processing effort is low

## Organization of Screen Elements
There are 10 elements of screen design:
### Balance
* Equal weight of screen elements
  * Left to right, top to bottom

**Balaanced** | **Unstable**
--------------|-------------
![balance-1](files/balance-1/png)<br>Left column processed - right column  start position noted as same | ![balance-2](files/balance-2/png)<br>Both columns need to be completely processed

### Symmetry
* Replicate elements left and right of the center line

**Symmetric** | **Asymmetric**
--------------|---------------
![symmetry-1](files/symmetry-1.png)<br>Left column processed - right column noted as same | ![symmetry-2](files/symmetry-2.png)<br>Both left & right columns processed plus relationship of right to left

### Regularity
* Create standard and consistent spacing on horizontal and vertical alignment points

**Regular** | **Irregular**
------------|--------------
![regularity-1](files/regularity-1.png)<br>Left column processed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 right columns noted as same | ![regularity-2](files/regularity-2.png)<br>Location & size of each object processed

### Predictability
### Sequentiality
### Economy
### Unity
### roportion
### Simplicity
### Groupings
