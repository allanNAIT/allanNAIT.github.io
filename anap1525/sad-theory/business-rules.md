title: Business Rules

## Introduction
* A business manages its own behavior through carefully selected and communicated rules
* A business introduces change by changing its business rules
* It is important for analysts to document these rules as they may affect information systems.

## What is a Business Rule?
**DEFINED**:  A business rule, is a statement that influences the behavior of an organization.
* It helps employees make decisions without having to ask a manager every time.
* An information system should support and enforce these rules.
* Good rules can help create new knowledge from existing information.  
* There is a good chance these rules are not written down.  So observe carefully.

## How does that work?
**EXAMPLE**: 
Hotel has a rule that a customer can only check in if they have a reservation.

**SITUATION**: 
Customer arrives and says “I saw your vacancy and would like to check into a room.”
Clerk responds, “Do you have a reservation?”
Customer says “No.”

The above business rule must be satisfied. So the clerk responds “Just a moment while I make a reservation for you.  Then we can get you checked in.”

## Properties of a Good Business Rule
* **ATOMIC** - Cannot be decomposed without losing meaning. (No use of “and”, “or”, “but”.)
* **DECLARATIVE** – It explains “how to”, where and when the rule is imposed.
* **PRECISE** - Has only one interpretation.
* **JUSTIFIED** - Supports the objectives of the  business.
* **AUTHORIZED** – Someone relevant to the business is empowered to create the rule.  (i.e., the janitor does not have authority to create a rule on how orders are received.)

## Business Rule Examples
* Everyone  that appears to be under the age of 25 years needs to have their ID checked.
* We only ship complete orders.
* Before a work order can be completed, a customer’s information must be collected.
* Any customer that owes more than $5,000.00 cannot place new orders.
* All vehicles require a visual inspection for damage before being released to the customer.

2.  Translate these ramblings into business rules
