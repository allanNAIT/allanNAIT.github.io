## What is Risk?
Risk is the effect (positive or negative) of an event or series of events that will have an impact on a project. 
**Purpose**:
* The purpose of Risk Analysis is to identify potential problems to help avoid or reduce their effects.  
* If it is a positive opportunity, then take advantage of it should it occur.

## Risk Affects Project Planning
* An important part of planning a project.
* Helps to prevent turning small problems into emergencies.
* Primarily part of Planning phase.
* Continues to change through the whole project.

## Risk is Made Up of
* **Event**: What could happen? 
* **Probability**: How likely is it to happen?
* **Impact**: How bad will it be if it happens?
* **Mitigation**: How can you reduce the probability (and by how much)?
* **Contingency**: How can you reduce the impact (and by how much)?

## Create a Risk List
For each event on the risk list:
* Describe the risk event briefly. (1 – 2 sentences)
* What is the probability of the risk. (High, Medium, Low)
* Mitigation is about reducing the probability that a risk will occur. 
* What is the impact of the risk on the project. (High, Medium, Low)
* Contingency is about reducing the impact if the risk does materialize.

## What is the Probability?
* Probability as High, Medium or Low.
* Do mitigation for High and Medium elements first
* You might want to mitigate Low risk items.
  * **Note**: If the probability of an event occurring is zero, then remove it from consideration. There is no reason to consider things that simply cannot happen (Enraged T-Rex eats the computer).

## What is the Impact?
* Impact as High, Medium or Low
* High – cause major damage possible failure of project.
* Medium – some effect to project that could increase cost or delay delivery.
* Low – minor effect but must still be dealt with to avoid it getting worse.

## Example of a Risk Event
* **Event**: Critical parts you need do not arrive on time.
* **Probability**: Medium
* **Mitigation**: Order parts early in the project. 
* **Impact**: High
* **Contingency**: Use old, existing parts while you are waiting for the new ones.

## What to do?
* Discuss with team members ideas.
* Keep reasonable risks (start with most important first)
* Discard silly or risks that no longer apply.
* Remember this process continues through the entire project.
