title: Introduction to Programming - Problem Solving
---

## Introduction
The best workflow when learning how to program is to ***NOT*** open your coding environment and start writing code. The first thing you should do is go through the logical **Problem Solving Process**.

## Problem Solving Process
1.	Understand the Problem
2.	Clearly define the expected outcome
3.	Clearly define/gather all data
4.	List major tasks in an organized sequence
5.	Write pseudocode or draw a detailed flowchart (algorithm) or pseudo-code
6.	Test the logic
7.	Write the code

### Example Problem
Create a simple calculator. Your calculator will accept two numbers inputted by a user, perform the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท), and display the results.

_This problem will be worked through in class._
