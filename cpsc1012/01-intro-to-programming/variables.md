## Introduction
**CONCEPT**: In order to be successful in writing programming code it is not only important to know how to code, but what is needed for the code, i.e., **variable**s that will hold the data needed to solve the programming problem and a data type for each variable identified. Additionally, you will need to identify any data that will not change in your program code, this type of data is called a **constant**.

## Variable and Constant Identification Problems
For each of the following problems, identify the required variable(s) by underlining, highlighting, or other means. Write down a name and an appropriate simple data type (e.g., string, number, character, etc.) for each variable you identify.
1. The West Coast sales unit of a company generates 43 percent of the companyâ€™s total sales. Based on this percentage, write a program that will determine how much the West Coast unit will generate if the company has $5.3 million in sales this year.
2. One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that calculates the number of acres in a tract of land with a user provided value of square feet.
3. A bag of cookies holds 26 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that there are 10 servings in the bag and that each serving equals 175 calories. Write a program that lets the user enter the number of cookies he or she actually ate and then reports the number of total calories consumed.
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter three test scores. The program should display each test score, as well as the average test of the scores.
5. Write a program that asks for the names of three runners and the time, in minutes, it took each of them to finish a race. The program should display the names of the runners in the order that they finished.
