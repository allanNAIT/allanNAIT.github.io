## Introduction
There are several ways to create a coding solution in **C#**. You could type all your code in a text editor, then, in a command prompt, do a command-line compile of your code, then run the executeable file created. Doing it this way makes debugging very difficult. The other options use Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs). The two that work best for beginners are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. In this course we will **only** use Visual Studio.

## Visual Studio
There are several versions of Visual Studio available. The one that is recommended is the [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16){:target="_blank"}.

This is a free version of Visual Studio and the only requirement to use this application beyond the 30-day trial, is to have a **free** Microsoft account. While you are a student, you can use your NAIT login ID as your Microsoft account. After you finish at NAIT, and want to keep using Visual Studio Community Edition, you will need to register for a **free** Microsoft account.
