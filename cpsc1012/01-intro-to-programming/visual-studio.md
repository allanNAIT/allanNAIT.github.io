## Introduction
There are several ways to create a coding solution in **C#**. You could type all your code in a text editor, then, in a command prompt, do a command-line compile of your code, then run the executeable file created. Doing it this way makes debugging very difficult. The other options use Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs). The two that work best for beginners are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/){:targt="_blank"}. In this course we will **only** use Visual Studio.
