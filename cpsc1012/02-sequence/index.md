---

## Introduction
This section introduces you to some fundamental coding practices and workflows. You will be introduced to the **C#** programming language through small Console Applicaitons. The coding structure is call **Simple Sequence** as each code line is read and executed as a sequence from the top to the bottom of the code file. This concept is fundamental as it outlines a series of coding steps that will be common in almost all coding scenarios. These concepts will be used throughout this course.

## Coding Topics
You will learn about the following:
* [Input/Output](input-output.md)
* [Math in C#](arithmetic.md)
* [Some simple string processing](strings.md)
