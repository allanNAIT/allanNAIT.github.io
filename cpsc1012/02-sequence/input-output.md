## Introduction
This topic will focus on inputting data into, and outputting data from, your application. The main C# code in this section is:

```csharp
//Input into your code
Console.ReadLine();

//Output from your code - same display line
Console.Write();

//Output from your code - adding a CRLF
Console.WriteLine();
```

## Your First Console Application
This first Console Application will not only test the code for this lesson, but also test you can create a Console Application in Visual Studio.

### Steps
1. Start Visual Studio
2. If using the **Start Window**, select the ![create-project](files/create-project.jpg) from the options shown. If using the **Empty Environment**, select ![new-project](files/new-project.jpg).
3. From the **Create a new project** wizard, make the following selections:<br>![new-project-wizard-1](files/new-project-wizard-1.jpg)<br>You need to select the **Console App (.NET Framework)** option then press **Next**
4. On the next wizard screen make the following changes (if you have a different **Location**, based on your preferences from the Options, then use that one):<br>![new-project-wizard-2](files/new-project-wizard-2.jpg)<br>The checkbox on **Place solution and project in the same directory** is strongly recommended.
5. Press **Create** to see the following:<br>![first-project-created](files/first-project-created.jpg)

### Examining the Project
There are a few things to notice about this project you have just created:
1. The **Solution Explorer** shows all the files associated with this project. The application name is **bolded** which means it is the startup project; it will run when you press the **Start** button on the menu bar.
2. The **Code Window** shows you the code that was auto-generated by Visual Studio:<br>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Lines 1-5: these are automatically added by Visual Studio. They reperesent the <em>standard or common</em> namespaces for Visual Studio code files.
        <li><b>namespace</b>: for this course it will always be the name of the application created. This is the overall <em>container</em>for our code.</li>
        <li><b>class Program</b>: this is the application; you can change this name but it is recommended to leave it as is.</li>
        <li><b>static void Main(string[] args)</b>: this is the main entry point to the code that will execute when we press the **Start** button. You will be writing code in this <em>method</em>.</li>
    </ol>
