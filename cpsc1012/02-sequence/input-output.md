## Introduction
This topic will focus on inputting data into, and outputting data from, your application. The main C# code in this section is:

```csharp
//Input into your code
Console.ReadLine();

//Output from your code - same display line
Console.Write();

//Output from your code - adding a CRLF
Console.WriteLine();
```

## Your First Console Application
This first Console Application will not only test the code for this lesson, but also test you can create a Console Application in Visual Studio.
