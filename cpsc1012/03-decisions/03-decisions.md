title: Decision Structures
---

## Introduction
This section builds on the concepts of the **[Simple Sequence Structure](../02-sequence/02-sequence.md)**. Here you will learn about the branching logic; branching logic uses the results of a **boolean test**; a test that will return `true` or `false`. Branching logic is one of the most common coding structures; almost every application has some form of a branching structure in its code. These concepts will be used throughout this course.

## Coding Topics
You will learn about the following:
* [If-Then-Else](if-then-else.md)
* [Switch Structure](switch.md)
