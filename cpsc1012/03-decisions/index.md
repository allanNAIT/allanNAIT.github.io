title: Decision Structures

## Introduction
This section builds on the concepts of the **[Simple Sequence Structure](../02-sequence/02-sequence.md)**. Here you will learn about the branching logic; branching logic uses the results of a **boolean test**; a test that will return `true` or `false`. Branching logic is one of the most common coding structures; almost every application has some form of a branching structure in its code. These concepts will be used throughout this course.

## Relational Operators
The **boolean test** uses one or more of the following relational operators:

Relational Operator | Meaning
--------------------|--------
**`<`** | Less than
**`<=`** | Less than or equal to
**`>`** | Greater than
**`>=`** | Greater than or equal to
**`!=`** | No equal to
**`==`** | Equal to

_**Note**: The **`=`** symbol is an **assignment opertor**!_

## Logical Operators
The **boolean test** uses zero or more of the following logical operators:

Logical Operator | Meaning
-----------------|--------
**`&&`** | A logical `AND`; both sides of the expression **MUST** be true for the condition to be true
**`||`** | A logical `OR`; if either side of the expression is true, the condition is true
**`!`** | A logical `NOT`; negates the logical result, i.e., if the condition is TRUE, then it will negate it to be a FALSE

## Coding Topics
You will learn about the following:
* [If-Then-Else](if-then-else.md)
* [Switch Structure](switch.md)
