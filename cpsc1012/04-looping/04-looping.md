title: Looping Structures
---

## Introduction
This section builds on the concepts of the **[Simple Sequence Structure](../02-sequence/02-sequence.md)** and **[Decision Structures](../03-decisions/03-decisions.md)**. Like Decision Structures, a **Looping Structure** relies on a **boolean test**. Unlike Decision Structures, the **boolean test** is used as an entry or exit condition of the Looping Structure, i.e., a repeating block of code. The Looping Structure is used to surround code that needs to run repeatedly until the exit condition is met. These concepts will be used throughout this course.

## Coding Topics
* [While Loop](while.md)
* [Do Loop](do-loop.md)
* [For Loop](for-loop.md)
* [Nested Loops](nested.md)
