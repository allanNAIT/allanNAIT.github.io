## Introduction
**CONCEPT**: Methods are required too be able to write, and maintain, larger programs. A method is a reusable block of code to do _something_. Methods also help with code organization and readability. Each method in a program has a unique signature:
*  Method name, and
*  Data type order of 0 or more parameters.

_Note: Two, or more, methods can have the same name and still be unique if their individual data type paramter lists are different; this is called **overloading**._

> A parameter is a means of passing a value into a method call. The method is given the data to work on.

## Types of Methods
There are basically 4 types of methods:
*  Does not return a value and has 0 paramters (a `void` method)
*  Does not return a value and has 1 or more parameters (a `void` method)
*  Returns a value and has 0 paramters
*  Returns a value and has 1 or more parameters
