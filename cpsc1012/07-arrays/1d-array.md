title: Arrays - 1D Arrays
---
## Introduction
The first type of array you will learn is the 1D array (it is the most common).

## Objectives
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1. Declare a 1D array
2. Load a 1D array
3. Display a 1D array

## How to Create an Array?
There are some things you need to know before you can create an array:
* What type of data will be stored: **each element of the array must be of the same type of data**
* How many elements: **normally once an array is created it cannot be made to hold more** elements than it was originally designed to hold

Once you know about an array you can give it a name: **the naming follows the same naming conventions that we use for variables**

### Array Syntax

Pseudo Code | Data Type | #Of Elements | C# Syntax
Declare age[6] As int | int | 6 | `int[] age = new int[6]`;
Declare mark[25] As double | double | 25 | `double[] mark = new double[25];`
Declare name[100] As string | string | 100 | `string[] name = new string[100];`
Declare gender[75] As char | char | 75 | `char[] gender = new char[75];`
