title: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction
The following information was retrieved from [Welcome to object-oriented programming](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/welcome-to-object-oriented-programming/){:target="_blank"}

> "In traditional programming (what we’ve been doing prior to this point), programs are basically lists of instructions to the computer that define data (via objects) and then work with that data (via statements and functions). Data and the functions that work on that data are separate entities that are combined together to produce the desired result. Because of this separation, traditional programming often does not provide a very intuitive representation of reality. It’s up to the programmer to manage and connect the properties (variables) to the behaviors (functions) in an appropriate manner. This leads to code that looks like this:

```
driveTo(you, work);
```

> So, what is object-oriented programming? As with many things, it is perhaps understood most easily through use of an analogy. Take a look around you -- everywhere you look are objects: books and buildings and food and even you. Objects have two major components to them: 1) A list of relevant properties (e.g., weight, color, size, solidity, shape, etc.), and 2) Some number of behaviors that they can exhibit (e.g., being opened, making something else hot, etc.). These properties and behaviors are inseparable.

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) provides us with the ability to create objects that tie together both properties and behaviors into a self-contained, reusable package. This leads to code that looks more like this:

```
you.driveTo(work);
```

> This not only reads more clearly, it also makes it clearer who the subject is (you) and what behavior is being invoked (driving somewhere). Rather than being focused on writing functions, we’re focused on defining objects that have a well-defined set of behaviors. This is why the paradigm is called "object-oriented".
