## A
* **Attributes** are pieces of data that describe an entity. For example, a _Customer_ entity may have the following attributes: customer number, last name, first name, address, and phone number.

Attributes are either _atomic_ or _composite_. Composite attributes are attributes that could be sub-divided. For example, _CustomerName_ is composite, but _CustomerFirstName_ and _CustomerLastName_ would be atomic.

_Derived_ attributes are those that are not actually stored in the database, but could be calculated, like _OrderAmount_ could be derived by multiplying Quantity and Price.

## D
* Attributes have a **data type** which describes the kind of data it can hold (e.g. numeric).
* Attributes also have a **domain** which are the legitimate values it can hold (e.g., “greater than zero”).
