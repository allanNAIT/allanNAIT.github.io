## Demo Instructions
You can follow along with your instructor to complete this build and/or you can use this document as a guide in completing the demo build.

## Steps
1.	Download the **demo-facicon.zip** file and extract its contents to a folder named **demo-favicon**.
2.	As there will be no HTML or CSS, there is no final web output for this demo.
3.	Download the **dmit1530-icon.png** file and save it to the **demo-favicon** folder.
4.	Open the Favicon Generator website to see:<br>
![favicon-01.jpg](files/favicon-01.jpg)
5.	Using the Select your Favicon Image button, open the dmit1530-icon.png file. You will get a warning that the image is not square:<br>
![favicon-02.jpg](files/favicon-02.jpg)<br>
Just press **Continue with this picture**.
6.	On the next screen there are many options, but just scroll down to find the
**Generate your Favicons HTML code** button to generate your icons.<br>
![favicon-03.jpg](files/favicon-03.jpg)
7.	On the next screen you can download your Favicon package and see the code to paste into the `<head>` section of your web page.<br>
![favicon-04.jpg](files/favicon-04.jpg)<br>
Download the ZIP file and extract its contents to the **demo-favicons** folder.
8.	Now copy the code and paste it into the `<head>` section of your index.html file just below the `<title>` element.<br>
![head-index.01.jpg](files/head-index-01.jpg)<br>
That is all there is to it â€¦ you can try this with your own png icons.
9.	To complete this lesson, open the [Meta Description](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description#:~:text=The%20meta%20description%20is%20an,can%20influence%20click-through%20rates.){:target="_blank"} web link and review the reference.
