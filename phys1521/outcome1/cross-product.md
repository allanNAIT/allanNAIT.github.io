## Introduction
The other key vector concept is that of the Cross Product. The Cross Product differs from the Dot Product, whose result is a scalar, in that it produces another 3D vector. <span class="red">There is NO Cross Product for 2D vectors.</span>

## Cross Product
### Key Concepts
The key concepts for this part of the lesson are:
* Computing a Cross Product
* Computing the Surface Normal

### Lesson
As stated in the previous lesson, the multiplication of vectors is different from multiplying scalar values. For example, we know that:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\left[\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 3 \\4\end{array}\right]\cdot{\left[\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 2 \\ -2\end{array}\right]}=10+(-6)+(-8)=-4"/>

However, the other symbol for multiplication, `x`, produces a different result:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\left[\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 3 \\4\end{array}\right]\times{\left[\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 2 \\ -2\end{array}\right]}=\left[\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 24 \\ 19\end{array}\right]"/>

Looking at this result the computation is not obvious.
