title: Dot Product

## Introduction
There are certain mathematical concepts with vectors that are key. One such concept is that of the Dot Product. In math classes you were introduced, initially, to expressions like 2 × 3 = 6. Later on the teacher(s) probably wrote this as 2 ∙ 3 = 6. For pure numbers, or scalar values, both of these expressions are valid, but this is not true for vectors.

## Dot Product
### Key Concepts
The key concepts for this part of the lesson are:
* Computing a Dot Product
* Application of the Dot Product, i.e., projections and angle between two vectors

### Lesson
As stated in the introduction, the multiplication of vectors is different from multiplying scalar values. For example:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\left[\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 3\end{array}\right]\cdot\left[\begin{array}{c}4 \\ 5\end{array}\right]=23"/>

The actual calculation is pretty straight forward:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;A\centerdot{B}=A_{x}B_{x}+A_{y}B_{y}=(2)(4)+(3)(5)=8+15=23"/>
