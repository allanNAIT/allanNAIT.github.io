1. Given θ = 20<sup>o</sup> and hypotenuse = 4, then adjacent = **??** and opposite= **??**.
2.	Given θ = 40<sup>o</sup> and hypotenuse = 6, then adjacent = **??** and opposite = **??**.
3.	Given θ = 20<sup>o</sup> and opposite = 4, then hypotenuse = **??** and adjacent = **??**.
4.	Given θ = 40<sup>o</sup> and opposite = 4, then hypotenuse = **??** and adjacent = **??**.
5.	Given θ = 20<sup>o</sup> and adjacent = 4, then hypotenuse = **??** and opposite = **??**.
6.	Given θ = 40<sup>o</sup> and adjacent = 4, then hypotenuse = **??** and opposite = **??**.
7.	Given adjacent = 5 and opposite = 3 then hypotenuse = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
8.	Given adjacent = 3 and opposite = 5 then hypotenuse = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
9.	Given adjacent = 6 and opposite = 2 then hypotenuse = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
10.	Given adjacent = 2 and opposite = 6 then hypotenuse = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
11.	Given adjacent = 2 and hypotenuse = 5 then opposite = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
12.	Given adjacent = 2 and hypotenuse = 6 then opposite = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
13.	Given adjacent = 4 and hypotenuse = 5 then opposite = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
14.	Given adjacent = 4 and hypotenuse = 6 then opposite = **??** and θ = **??**<sup>o</sup>.
