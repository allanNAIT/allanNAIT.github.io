title: Multiplication of Two Quaternions
---

## Introduction
Although not covered in the notes on Moodle, this topic may be of interest for those who want to know more about Quaternions. What is important in this topic is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;Q_{1}\times{Q_{2}}\neq{Q_{2}\times{Q_{1}}}"/>. This is from the fundamental principle that rotations are not communative.

## Multiplying Two Quaternions
Given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;Q_{1}=(w_{1},V_{1})"/> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;Q_{2}=(w_{2},V_{2})"/>, the multiplication of Quaternions follows: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;Q_{1}{Q_{2}}=w_{1}w_{2}-V_{1}\cdot{V_{2}},w_{1}V_{2}+w_{2}V_{1}+V_{1}\times{V_{2}}"/>.
