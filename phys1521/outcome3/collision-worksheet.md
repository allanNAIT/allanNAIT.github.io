## Momentum
1.	Given a 45kg object with an initial Velocity of 3.5 m/s. Calculate the objects momentum and how long it would take to stop if a braking force of 12.5 N was to be applied.
2.	Given a 525kg object with an initial Velocity of 12.5 m/s. Calculate the objects momentum and how long it would take to stop if a braking force of 125.5 N was to be applied.

## Circle Collisions
1.	Given two circular objects A and B (defined below) which collide with each other, calculate their final velocities:<br>
A: (-2.5, 3.5), radius = 0.15m, mass=0.50kg, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_{Ai}=\left[\begin{array}{c}1.1\\2.2\end{array}\right]m/s"/><br>
B: (1.4, -2.4), radius=0.20m, mass=0.45kg, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_{Bi}=\left[\begin{array}{c}-0.1\\1.2\end{array}\right]m/s"/>

## Sphere Collisions
1.	Given two spherical objects A and B (defined below) which collide with each other, calculate their final velocities:<br>
A: (-2.5, 3.5, 1.1), radius = 0.25m, mass=0.55kg, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_{Ai}=\left[\begin{array}{c}0.1\\1.04\\2\end{array}\right]m/s"/><br>
B: (1.4, -2.4, -1.1), radius=0.10m, mass=0.35kg, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_{Bi}=\left[\begin{array}{c}0.2\\-2.5\\1.1\end{array}\right]m/s"/>
