title: Other Forces - Momentum & Collisions
---
## Introduction
This lesson will include an additional concept related to Linear Mechanics.

## Momentum & Impulse
### Key Concepts
The key concepts for this part of the lesson are:
* Calculations based on Momentum
* Calculations based on Impulse forces

### Lesson
Which object, a 1000kg car or a 5000kg truck, both travelling at the same speed, will come to a stop once their respective drivers stop pressing the accelerator pedals (assuming both at the same time, and both having the same friction on the road surface). The answer should be that the truck will take longer to slow to a complete stop. The reason is that the truck has a larger momentum. Using Newton’s First Law, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;F=mA"/> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V=A\Delta{t}"/> the equation of Momentum is derived as follows:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;A=\frac{F}{m}"/>

Substitute this into the velocity equation

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V=\frac{F}{m}\Delta{t}"/>

Now some simple algrbraic rearranging

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;mV=F\Delta{t}=P"/>

The units of momentum can be expressed as _kg∙m/s_ or _N∙s_. It should also be obvious, based on the equations used, that Momentum is a vector quantity; has both magnitude and direction.

Example: Consider the car and truck from the opening lesson statement, both traveling at 60 km/h calculate the momentum of each vehicle and the time it will take each vehicle to come to a complete stop with a braking force of 10N.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\frac{60km}{hr}=\frac{60\times{1000}}{1}\times{\frac{1}{60\times{60}}}=\frac{50}{3}m/s"/>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;P_{car}=1000\times{\frac{50}{3}}\approx{16666.6667Ns}"/>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;P_{truck}=5000\times{\frac{50}{3}}\approx{83333.333Ns}"/>

Now calculate the time to stop each vehicle:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\Delta{t_{car}}=\frac{P_{car}}{F_{brake}}=\frac{\frac{50000}{3}}{10}\approx{1666.6667s}"/>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\Delta{t_{truck}}=\frac{P_{truck}}{F_{brake}}=\frac{\frac{250000}{3}}{10}\approx{8333.3333s}"/>
