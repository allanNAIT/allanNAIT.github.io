## Using UGF
1. Given two celestial bodies, masses are 3750kg and 2.5×10<sup>12</sup> kg. If the distance between the bodies is 220000m (center to center) calculate the force of attraction between the two bodies.
2. Given two celestial bodies, masses are 75000kg and 5.5×10<sup>10</sup> kg. If the distance between the bodies is 2500000m (center to center) calculate the force of attraction between the two bodies.

## Calculate Gravity
1. Calculate the gravity of Venus which has a mass of 4.8675×10<sup>24</sup>kg and a radius of 6,052 km. Compare your calculated results with a Google search.
2. Calculate the gravity of a celestial body which has a mass of 8.675×10<sup>23</sup>kg and a radius of 7250 km.
