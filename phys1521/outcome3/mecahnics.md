## Introduction
This lesson will extend the concepts learned in Lesson 3.1 to include how to get object moving and what happens when they are moving. To accomplish use this introduction of Newton’s Laws.

Modern mechanics has evolved from the classical mechanics of Sir Isaac Newton; the inclusion of the work by Albert Einstein, and others, has changed, somewhat, the work done by Sir Isaac Newton. The fundamentals of Newton’s work is summarized in his three laws.

>**Newton's First Law**<br>Every body persists in a state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.

>**Newton's Second Law**<br>The acceleration of a body is proportional to (and in the same direction as) the net external force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to the mass of the body:<br>

>**Newton's Third Law**<br>To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Or, the force of two bodies on each other are always equal and directed in opposite directions.

So, looking at the 1<sup>st</sup> law why does an object not keep moving, it eventually comes to a stop, after it is compelled to move? Friction. Friction is an external force that opposes motion, but it was quite the statement in its day. Also, a force is required to move an object.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> law’s formula is so simple but very important; it is fundamental to this lesson. Using the standard units for mass and acceleration we get:

It is important that a force does not produce velocity, only acceleration; an application of the linear motion equations from lesson 3.1 will yield a given velocity, and displacement, over a period.

Finally, the 3<sup>rd</sup> law. This law will come into play in almost every situation. For example, a body that is seen to be not moving does not mean that there are no forces acting on it, simply that this could be true, or all the forces balance each other out in opposite directions and thus no motion.

One thing that is important in real world physics is that the continued application of an applied force, over a very large period, does not result in speeds greater than the speed of light. Additionally, as Einstein formulated, and what has been learned so far, everything is relative to a certain view of the world, game world or real world.
