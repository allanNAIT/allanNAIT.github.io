## Rotational Speed
1.	Given an object, of radius 0.25m, rotating at 6400 RPM calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;ω (rad/s)"/> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;α (rad/s^2)"/>.
2.	Given an object, of radius 0.35m, rotating at 9600 RPM calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;ω (rad/s)"/> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;α (rad/s^2)"/>.

## Angular Velocity – Pt. 1
1.	Given a rotation through an arc length of 1.25m, with a radius of rotation to be 0.75m. After 2 seconds calculate Δθ (radians and degrees), ω (rad/s), and V<sub>T</sub> (m/s).
2.	Given a rotation through an arc length of 0.45m, with a radius of rotation to be 1.75m. After 0.5 seconds calculate Δθ (radians and degrees), ω (rad/s), and V<sub>T</sub> (m/s).

## Angular Velocity – Pt. 2
1. Given ω=2.6 m/s calculate the tangential velocities (m/s) of two objects one at a radius of 0.25m and the other at 0.85m.
2. Given ω=5.4 m/s calculate the tangential velocities (m/s) of two objects one at a radius of 1.25m and the other at 2.85m.
