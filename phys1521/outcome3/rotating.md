## Introduction
This lesson will extend the concepts learned in Lesson 3.1 to motion that is circular, i.e., motion of an object in a circular path about a specific point. There will be some new terminology which some students may already know the names but not the formal definitions.

## Uniform Circular Motion
### Key Concepts
The key concepts for this part of the lesson are:
* Understand circular motion.
* Calculate motion properties of a rotating body.

### Lesson
#### Angular Velocity
If an object is traveling in a circle the path of the object is circular, not linear as shown in the figure below.<br>

Examining this figure, the value of the radius has no effect on the change in angle. The formula for angular velocity is:

#### Angular Acceleration
If the rate of change of angle increases, or decreases, (i.e., Ï‰ changes), then there is acceleration. The formula for angular acceleration is:

We can now use the knowledge from Linear Motion to get the following equations:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\Delta{\theta}=\omega_it+\frac{1}{2}\alpha{t^2}"/>

#### Tangential Velocity
What about the _physical_ velocity, i.e., the velocity felt at a point on a circle? In the figure, below, we see a possible scenario:<br>

Here we see that arc<sub>1</sub> is smaller in length than arc<sub>2</sub>, which should tell us that, physically, P<sub>2</sub> is travelling faster than P<sub>1</sub>; it may not be obvious, but V<sub>t1</sub> has a smaller magnitude than V<sub>t2</sub>. This physical speed is Tangential Velocity. The formula for this is:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_t=\frac{\Delta{arc}}{t}"/>

Doing some substitution, we can determine the relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\Delta{\theta}=\frac{\Delta{arc}}{r}"/>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;V_t=\frac{\Delta{\theta}\cdot{r}}{t}=\omega{r}"/>
