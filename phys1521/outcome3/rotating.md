title: Rotational motion
---
## Introduction
This lesson will extend the concepts learned in Lesson 3.1 to motion that is circular, i.e., motion of an object in a circular path about a specific point. There will be some new terminology which some students may already know the names but not the formal definitions.

## Uniform Circular Motion
### Key Concepts
The key concepts for this part of the lesson are:
* Understand circular motion.
* Calculate motion properties of a rotating body.

### Lesson
#### Angular Velocity
If an object is traveling in a circle the path of the object is circular, not linear as shown in the figure below.<br>

Examining this figure, the value of the radius has no effect on the change in angle. The formula for angular velocity is:

#### Angular Acceleration
If the rate of change of angle increases, or decreases, (i.e., Ï‰ changes), then there is acceleration. The formula for angular acceleration is:

We can now use the knowledge from Linear Motion to get the following equations:
