## Springs – Calculate Spring Constant
1. Given the stretched length of a spring is 0.015m with a 0.02kg mass attached and g=-9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> then the spring constant is (N/m).

## Springs – Using Spring Constant
1. Using the spring constant calculated above, and the same mass and stretched length, calculate the frequency of oscillation (Hz) and the velocity of the mass at the rest length of the spring.
