title: Student Research/Application Project
---
This is a required component for PHYS1521 in which you will, individually or as part of a team, complete a research or application project and present your work to the remainder of the class.

## Parts of the Project
### Student Research/Application Project Proposal
Before you start the **Student Project** you must submit a proposal document. The purpose of this document is for you to provide to the instructor an overview of the Research, or Application, project for PHYS1521, and to get instructor feedback on items such as scope, practicality, and possible relevant sources. Additionally, you, or team, must get approval from the instructor for the chosen research/application project.

#### Project Topic
Outline your project topic in an overiew.

#### Rationale and Scope
Outline your reason(s) for choosing this project and what you will be doing to complete this project (i.e., demonstrating your application, a presentation, or both).

#### Name(s)
If you are working with another student, include their name in your proposal; only one member of a team needs to submit the project proposal document.

### Student Project
The concept of the Student Research Project is to challenge you to go beyond the material taught in the class and/or to merge concepts in a new way; both pertain to how Math & Physics can be used in a game programming environment. Although you have been instructed in the basics of Physics, and the math to make it work, there are many topics that simply cannot be covered in the 60 hours allotted for this course. This project can be completed in teams of two or three students (depending on the number of students).

#### Project Topic
The team must get approval from the instructor for the chosen research/application project. The topic chosen should meet one or more of the following guidelines:
1.	A research topic on applying multiple concepts of PHYS1521, such as forces and projectiles, or forces and collisions.
2.	A research topic on an area of game math and physics that was not covered in PHYS1521 such as rotational motion or soft-body physics.
3.	A research topic on an area of PHYS1521 that was not covered in depth, such as further exploration of quaternions or 3D math.
4.	Applying the concepts taught in PHYS1521 by adding relevant code to a small game programming application.

#### Project Guidelines
The final project is broken down into the following areas:
1. **Formal Report**: The formal report will be a written, electronic submission, report using proper report formatting, including citing of references. The report must be uploaded to Moodle. The report is 15 out of 25 marks of the project mark. The marking guide is available on Moodle.
2. **Project Presentaion**: A presentation to the class (in certain circumstances, the presentation can be scaled back to a smaller group) of approximately 10-15 minutes. After the presentation there will be a feedback/Q&A session. The presentation must be in a PowerPoint (or equivalent). The presentation is 10 out of 25 marks of the project mark. The rubric for the presentation is available on Moodle.
3. **Presentation Order & Etiquette**: The order of project presentations will be chosen randomly. Please hold all questions and comments until the end of each presentation.

### Submission Requirements
As two or more students are working as a team then only one student needs to upload a copy to Moodle, but the other member(s) MUST confirm the submission. The PowerPoint presentation is to be uploaded to Moodle with the same guidelines as the formal report electronic document. Application code needs to be uploaded as a ZIP file (can use one ZIP file for both the Presentation and the Application code).

#### File Naming Conventions
In each file naming convention, replace # with your team number:
* Report: **Team#_ProjectReport.docx**
* PowerPoint: **Team#_Presentation.pptx**
* Application: **Team#_SolutionName.ZIP** (replace SolutionName with your project’s name)

## Suggested Research Topics
The following is a list of possible research topics (students may propose any topic not in the list):
* Rotational Motion (advanced)
* Gears and Pulleys
* 3D projectiles
* Air resistance and Wind Effects
* Oscillations
* Collision Detection
* Springs (advanced)
* Buoyancy

## Suggested Application Projects
The following is a list of possible applications of concepts taught in PHYS1521 (students may propose any application not in the list):
* Demonstration of Projectile Motion
* Demonstration of a “Roller Coaster”
* Demonstration of Rotations and/or Transformations
* Demonstration of Applied Forces
* Demonstration of Collisions
